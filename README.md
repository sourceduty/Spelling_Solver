[Spelling Solver](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KbWgYE0kW-spelling-solver) is a specialized tool developed to help users improve their spelling skills through a structured guessing game format. It operates by challenging you to correctly spell a word across different levels of difficulty. The process starts by presenting a jumbled version of the word and progressively provides easier hints if the initial attempts are incorrect. This method not only tests your ability to recognize and correct jumbled letters but also reinforces the correct spelling through repetition and gradual correction.

By engaging with Spelling Solver, you can enhance your spelling abilities in a fun and interactive way. Each session with Spelling Solver offers a step-by-step challenge that aids in memorizing the spelling of words and understanding their structure. This is particularly useful for visual learners who benefit from seeing words in various forms. As you progress through the levels, you're not only learning how to spell a specific word correctly but also training your brain to recognize and fix similar mistakes in future, thereby improving your overall spelling proficiency.

Start a new game.

Great! To get started, please choose a difficulty level for the word you'll be guessing: easy, medium, hard, or very hard. Which one would you like?

hard

Alright! 

Here's your Level 1 challenge with a hard difficulty word:
dtalmui

Try to guess the correct spelling of this word.

talme

That's not quite right. 

Here's Level 2 to help you get closer:
datlmui

Give it another guess!

datre

That's still not correct. 

Let's move to Level 3:
datlmui

Try guessing again!

datif

Not quite. 

Here's Level 4:
datumi

You're getting closer! What's your next guess?

datres

That's not it either. 

Here's Level 5, which reveals the correct spelling of the word:
dilatium

Since this was Level 5, the game concludes here. Would you like to play another round or discuss something else?
