[Spelling Solver](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KbWgYE0kW-spelling-solver) is a specialized tool developed to help users improve their spelling skills through a structured guessing game format. It operates by challenging you to correctly spell a word across different levels of difficulty. The process starts by presenting a jumbled version of the word and progressively provides easier hints if the initial attempts are incorrect. This method not only tests your ability to recognize and correct jumbled letters but also reinforces the correct spelling through repetition and gradual correction.

By engaging with Spelling Solver, you can enhance your spelling abilities in a fun and interactive way. Each session with Spelling Solver offers a step-by-step challenge that aids in memorizing the spelling of words and understanding their structure. This is particularly useful for visual learners who benefit from seeing words in various forms. As you progress through the levels, you're not only learning how to spell a specific word correctly but also training your brain to recognize and fix similar mistakes in future, thereby improving your overall spelling proficiency.

### Example Usage

<details><summary>Spelling Solver: Hard Game</summary>
<br>

Start a new game.

Great! Let's start a new game. First, please choose the word length difficulty: easy, medium, hard, or very hard.

hard

Thanks for choosing the "hard" difficulty. Here's your Level 1 scramble:

rqeuie

Remember, no letters are in their correct order. What's your guess?

jdyfha

It looks like your guess doesn't match the scrambled word. Let's move to Level 2:

requie

The first letter is now correct. Give it another try!

jdyfha

That's not the correct spelling. Let's move to Level 3:

reuiqe

Now the first two letters are in the correct place. Try guessing the word again!

jdyfha

That guess doesn't seem to match the scrambled word either. Let's try Level 4:

requie

The first three letters are now correct. What do you think the word is?

jdyfha

It seems we're still not quite there. Now, we're on Level 5:

requie

This is the correct spelling of the word. Remember, the game concludes at this level. 

Would you like to play another round or need help with something else?
